(b) be responsible for the actions of all third parties who use the Services in connection with your account, including for any breaches of these Terms, and for all relevant charges and fees incurred by such third parties.<br/>

2.7 We will endeavour to provide our Services to you with reasonable care and skill. Because of the nature of video on demand internet services, at times our ability to do so will be outside of our control, including our Services’ reliance on other services that we do not own or control (e.g. internet or electricity). We cannot represent or guarantee that the Services will be:<br/> 

(a) interruption or fault free, or that any faults or errors will be able to be corrected;<br/> 

(b) available at any particular time or location;<br/> 

(c) available, or available without change, for any minimum period of time;<br/>

2.8 We will always try to restore any Service outage within our control as soon as we reasonably can.<br/>

2.9 We do not represent or guarantee that any or all Content forming part of our Services will be downloadable.<br/>

<b>Subscription Services</b><br/>

2.10 When you purchase a Neon subscription, a recurring charge is payable by you (in advance) to view a package of TV shows and movies (<b>Subscription</b>). Your Subscription is valid for a specified period of time (e.g. a calendar month or multiple calendar months) which is known as your subscription period.  Your Subscription automatically renews (and we will take payment) at the end of each subscription period. Your Subscription will automatically renew for the same period of time as your initial subscription period (unless we agree otherwise) until you end your Subscription.<br/>  

2.11 You may end your Subscription at any time by cancelling on the Neon website. If you end your Subscription in this way, you will be able to continue to use the Subscription until any prepaid period expires, after which time your Subscription will end. If you cancel during a free trial or cooling off period, then your Subscription will end immediately.<br/> 

2.12 Neon does not generally provide refunds for prepaid Neon Services.<br/> 

2.13 Even when your Subscription comes to an end your account will remain active so you can still purchase Services again, should you wish.  If you would like to delete your account details permanently, you may do so by sending a request to help@neontv.co.nz.<br/>

2.14 In addition to other rights in these Terms, Neon may end your Subscription or cancel your account with a minimum of one month’s notice at any time. If we end your Subscription under this clause before the end of your subscription period, we will give you a pro-rata refund to reflect any charges you have already paid us for the remainder of your subscription period following termination.<br/>

2.15 We may also cancel your use of all or any part of the Neon Services immediately if: <br/>

(a) it’s reasonably necessary to do so for operational or technical reasons;<br/>

(b) we believe on reasonable grounds that you’re using the Neon Services in breach of these Terms or there has been unauthorised access to your account; <br/>

(c) we are withdrawing the relevant Service; or <br/>

(d) you don’t pay applicable charges to us when due.<br/>

<b>Movie Rentals</b><br/>

2.16 Where we offer you Content on a rental basis (<b>Movie Rental</b>) you will be charged for the Movie Rental up front. Once you have paid for your Movie Rental you will have a limited period of time to view it before expiry.  See <b><a href="https://help.neontv.co.nz/support/solutions/articles/64000203728-what-are-movie-rentals-">here</a></b> for details of our Movie Rentals.<br/>

2.17 Movie Rentals are non-refundable.<br/>

<b>Download & Go</b><br/>

2.18 Where we offer you the ability to download selected TV shows and movies to a smart device for watching offline, your use of this feature will be subject to certain limitations. See <b><a href="https://helpneon.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/64000203645-how-do-i-download-content-on-neon-">here</a></b> for details on our Download & Go feature. <br/>

<b>3. YOUR ACCOUNT</b><br/>

<b>Account</b><br/>

3.1 You must create an account to access our Services.<br/>

3.2 We’ll communicate with you via the email address you register to your account so it must be valid and accessible by you. You are responsible for keeping the email address up to date.<br/>

3.3 If we have reason to suspect that you are in breach of these Terms or there has been unauthorised access to your account, we reserve the right to immediately terminate, cancel or suspend your account and revoke your access to the Services.<br/>

<b>4. CHARGES AND PAYMENT</b><br/>

4.1 The charges for our Services are described on our website and confirmed when you purchase the relevant Service (<b>Charges</b>). <br/> 

4.2 If you have a Subscription, we will automatically apply the Charges to the credit/debit card registered to your account at the beginning of every subscription period, unless the Subscription has been cancelled before that renewal. You will be billed for every subscription period on the same day (e.g. if your free trial ends on the 5th then you will be charged around the 5th of each month).<br/>

4.3 If an automatic renewal fails and we do not receive the Charges payable from you, we will notify you via email and suspend your Subscription. We will try for at least one week to renew your Subscription and then we may cancel your Subscription. You may reactivate your suspended Subscription by updating your current credit/debit card details on the Neon website. If you don’t want us to continue trying to renew your Subscription for the week, you may cancel your Subscription.<br/>

4.4 To rent a Movie Rental, you must pay with a valid credit/debit card. If there is already a valid credit/debit card registered to your account you can opt to use this one or you can enter a new card. <br/>

<b>Free Trials and Promotions</b><br/>

4.5 Free trial eligibility is determined by us at our sole discretion and we may limit eligibility to prevent free trial abuse. Existing or recent customers are not eligible for free trials. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment, or an account email address used with an existing or recent Neon account to determine eligibility. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.<br/>

4.6 If you have accepted a free trial of a Subscription, the Subscription will automatically renew after the expiry of the trial period and Charges will apply, unless you decide to end your Subscription before the expiry date.<br/>

<b>3rd Party Offer</b><br/>

4.7 If you signed up to Neon Services via a 3rd party, for example via your broadband provider (<b>3rd Party Offer</b>) some aspects of those Services, during the period of the 3rd Party Offer, such as your charges or billing obligations, will be governed by the terms entered into between you and the 3rd party.  Specific conditions may also apply which the 3rd party will disclose to you when you sign up for their products or services.<br/>

4.8 If you wish to cancel a Subscription obtained via a 3rd Party Offer, how you do this and when it takes effect may depend on the terms that apply to your 3rd Party Offer.  You may, for example, need to visit your account with the 3rd party and turn off auto-renew, or unsubscribe from the Neon Services through the 3rd party.<br/>
  
4.9 We are not responsible for any products and services provided with the 3rd Party Offer or by such 3rd parties. We may pay the provider of the 3rd Party Offer a commission relating to the Services we provide to you.<br/>

4.10 If you decide to cancel a direct Subscription to Neon and take up a 3rd Party Offer, the cancellation of your Subscription with us may take effect immediately from the date you sign up to the 3rd Party Offer which means your billing periods may overlap.  We will not provide you with a refund for any overlapping period.<br/>

<b>5. MAKING CHANGES</b><br/>

5.1 To ensure we can respond to the needs of our customers by continually improving Services, we may have to make changes to our Services, Content, Charges, technology, Usage Rules, and these Terms, from time to time.  We might also cancel or phase out certain Services. <br/> 

5.2 	We will give you advance notice of:<br/>

(a) any changes to the Terms that apply to you;<br/>

(b) any increase to your recurring charges (we will give at least 30 days' notice of this); and<br/>

(c) any major change we make to your Services, where we think the change may have a negative impact on a significant portion of affected customers (we will try to give at least 30 days' notice of this, where practicable),<br/>

<b>but</b> we may not give notice of changes that happen in the ordinary course of things, such as changes to our Content (which happens all the time as our rights, and customer interests change), or changes that we think will have a neutral or positive impact on affected customers.<br/> 
 
5.3 Where we notify you of any changes, we may do so by emailing you and/or publishing the change on our website. By continuing to use our Services after the change, you are agreeing to the change.  If you are unhappy with any change we have made, you may choose to end your Services at any time as described in clause 2.11.<br/> 

<b>6. CONTENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</b><br/>

6.1 All intellectual property and other rights in our Services, and any content included in those Services (including the Content), are owned by us or our licensors.

<b>9. CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AND LIABILITY</b><br/>

(b) take reasonable steps to keep performing the Services where we reasonably can. <br/>
